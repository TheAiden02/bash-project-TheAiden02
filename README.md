- [x] Described script purpose.
- [x] Filled out the self-evaluation.
- [x] Filled out the self-reflection.

## Script Purpose

This script's purpose is to translate text files into pig latin. To accomplish this, for each word in the script, if the word begins with a consonant, the first letter of the word is moved to the end of the word and the suffix "ay" is appended, so that candy becomes andycay. For words begging in a vowel, the first letter is left alone and the suffix "way" is appended, so that apple becomes appleway.

## Self-Evaluation

How many points out of 85 do you deserve on this assignment: `0-85`

I believe that I deserve 85 points on this assignment because it meets all of the requirements and works.

## Self-Reflection
I learned a lot about using regex in bash and especially using the sed command while working on this project. I found that the sed command is shockingly powerful and once I learned how to do it, rearranging words inside a text file using sed is actually really easy. It would be fun to play around and see what else could be done with this. I also improved my regular expression-writing skills, and got to understand capture groups a little better.

### How long it took you to finish this?
